It measures various enzymes, proteins, and substances produced by the liver, providing critical insights into its condition and helping to detect potential liver diseases or dysfunctions. Key components typically measured in an LFT include alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which indicate liver damage or inflammation when elevated. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels can suggest bile duct obstruction or liver disease, while bilirubin levels help identify jaundice and liver dysfunction. Additionally, albumin, a protein produced by the liver, is measured, as low levels may indicate liver disease </p>

                    <avoid class="font-normal text-gray-500 text-md md:text-lg mb-20" > Avoid any side effects after a blood test, you should:

                        Apply Pressure and Keep the Bandage On: This helps prevent bruising and bleeding at the puncture site.
                        
                        Stay Hydrated: Drinking water can help replenish any fluid loss and reduce the risk of dizziness or fainting.
                        
                        Avoid Strenuous Activities: Refrain from heavy lifting or intense exercise for the rest of the day to prevent strain on the puncture site.
                        
                        Rest if Necessary: If you feel lightheaded or weak, sit or lie down until you feel better.
                        
                        Monitor the Puncture Site: Check for any unusual swelling, redness, or pain, and report any concerns to a healthcare professional.
                        
                        By following these steps, you can minimize the risk of side effects after your blood test.</p>
